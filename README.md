# The Block Box
A collection of assorted building blocks, furniture and decorations!

### Overview

The Block Box is exactly what the name says - a box full of blocks!

Here you'll find a variety of block sets, furniture, light sources and decorations. Ever wanted to build an opulent mansion with gold and lapis? How about an industrial complex with iron and copper? Or maybe you just want to sit down in a chair and watch the sky lanterns fly? This mod has got you covered!

The Block Box aims to extend the block palette of Minecraft, adding blocks for themes and use cases that aren't well-covered by existing blocks. Also, the mod does not generate anything in your world - you can just drop it in at any time!

Take a look around and see if anything fits your next build!
